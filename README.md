# Friendly Chat android app.
This is the first part of the HW 2 of class EC601. This android application can send and receive text messages and images. It syncs with the friendly chat web application too.
During this project, I learnt how to design and build a GUI using android studio, and also how to add authentication using firebase.
To run the app, simply clone the repository and open it in android studio. From there, this app can be run either using the android emulator or can be exported to an android phone by generating a signed APK.
